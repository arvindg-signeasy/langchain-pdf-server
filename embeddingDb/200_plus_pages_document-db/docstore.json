So, when I first started asking: “what can we do \nbeyond Firefox to shape the future of the web?” \n \nI looked around for others with this ethos. \n \nI quickly found them in the world of learning. People \ntinkering with the academy. Hacking accreditation. \nBuilding new tools and paths to help all of us learn. \nPeople who looked a lot like Mozillians. Inspired, we \ndecided to do an experiment: gather 400 tinkerers, \nhackers and makers in Barcelona, half from the world \nof the web and half from the world of learning, to see \nwhat they might build. We called it the Mozilla Learning \nFreedom and the Web Festival.\n \nWe asked Anya Kamenetz – and the participants \nof the Mozilla Festival – to take a snapshot of this \nexperiment in action. The result is this book and the \naccompanying web app. Almost a year later, it’s amazing \nto look back at this snapshot.

Seismic waves are rumbling from the basement of the \nivory tower and the schoolhouse down your block. The demand for access \nto both existing and new models of learning is rising as uncontrollably as \nthe average temperature throughout the globe. Our society faces serious \nexistential threats, and the answers aren’t written in books. So there’s a \ngrowing urgency to shift toward models of learning that foster natural \ncreativity and innovation to produce new knowledge, new answers. Yet \nthe educational ecosystem is edging toward collapse—50 million univer\n-\nsity students in 2000 will become an estimated 250 million by 2025, even \nas educational costs rise at two to three times the rate of inflation. An \nestimated 400 million children around the world have too little access to \nformal schooling. No government in the world has a plan to fix this.\n \nMeanwhile, informal learning–the kind we do all day every day, as long \nas our eyes are open and we’re not in school–is going through a Cambrian \nexplosion in hackerspaces, libraries, museums, basements and garages. \n“How-to” is one of the top searches on Google. An entire generation of web \ngeeks is functioning more or less self-taught, because traditional curricula \ncan’t keep up with the skills they need.\n \nAll of which brings me to the second force, now arcing overhead—an \ninvisible mesh of electrical signals that connect the people in this square \nnot only to each other, but the world.","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":26}}}],["53604dc9-7c90-4a08-b882-06958383b79a",{"pageContent":"26\nThe Web: A set of building blocks that anyone can use to invent, \nbuild, connect, and bend things in the digital world.\nTwenty-five years ago, computer engineers Tim Berners-Lee and Robert \nCaillou first introduced their creation: “The World Wide Web was devel\n-\noped to be a pool of human knowledge and human culture, which would \nallow collaborators in remote sites to share their ideas and all aspects of \na common project.” Today, the web’s open and interoperable standards \nmake it possible for 1.75 billion people around the world to build, access, \nconnect, and alter 240 million unique sites, not to mention for millions of \npeople to create and upload 35 hours of video to YouTube, the most popu\n-\nlar video site, every minute.

The goal is to develop new \ntools and practices that can supplement, optimize, and/or replace the tra\n-\nditional trappings of the education system, from diplomas and textbooks to \nlectures and lesson plans–the better to serve learners’ needs.\n \nAnd amidst the code sprints, why not brainstorm a wish list, too: What \ntools remain to be developed to allow learners of all ages to form the ques\n-\ntions, find or create the answers, build skills, and participate in communi\n-\nties? What allies and teams need to form to make these things happen?\n \nFinally, if successful, the manifesto of two days becomes the manifest \nof a much longer voyage: A call for all those who care to spread webcraft \nliteracy, to play with technology, to learn by making stuff together, to \nkeep the web free by making it ourselves, to shape society through more \ndemocratic design, to pull learning out of the 15th or 19th century and into \nthe 21st, to find strength in diversity, and to think critically about–and tell \njoyful stories about–all this doing and building and learning and making \nand sharing, all the better to get more people involved.\n \nSo lightning struck the clock tower, two worldviews faced each other \nin a public square, and “Learning, Freedom and the Web” was born.

As we call for change, it’s easy to dwell on their limitations, or to \nbrush past them altogether in the eagerness to hack shiny, new \n \nalternatives.\n \nThis would be a fatal error. As we swing out over uncharted territory, \nlearners continue to need institutions, just as institutions need learners.\n \nAt the very least, traditional institutions convene communities of people \nwho love learning—and sign many of their paychecks. The existing school\n-\ning infrastructure from kindergarten to state university is a crucial public \nasset to leverage toward the future of open learning. For a thousand years, \nat least some learning has taken place inside formal institutions, and it \nmight benefit the future of learning to figure out how free and open learn\n-\ning might emerge from that history. Plus, the best institutions maintain an \nanarchic and decentralized structure that allows for all kinds of research \nand innovation to take place—like the early stages of the Internet, for one. \nWhy not take advantage of them to innovate learning itself?\nLaura Hilliger of the \nKnight Digital Media \nCenter wrote in \nresponse to a draft \nof this work:\nhttp://multimedia.\njournalism.berkeley.\nedu/people/\nLauraHilliger/\n  \n“Although our universities, colleges and traditionally run schools are \noutdated and in desperate need of change, they are still institutions \nof learning, innovation and stimulation. We, the educators and web \nnerds who make up “Learning, Freedom and the Web,” aren’t looking to \ndestroy the infrastructure we have in place, we’re looking to change how \nthat infrastructure is used. I’m thinking about the innovation that comes \nfrom the FREE and OPEN learning within these institutions, like Marie \nCurie having access to a lab, or, to use an example which both pisses me \noff and also changed the world, Mark Zuckerberg being inspired by his \nsocial surroundings to come up with Facebook.

With sessions such as “Storming the Gradebook” \nand “Storming the Syllabus,” her team brought a sense of what she likes to \ncall Joyful insurgency into the hallowed traditions of the academy. \n“What?

We want to be able to \nshow that “thinking” is an activity and that \n“interaction” can occur with notecards and \nmarkers as well as on a computer. We want \nto be inspired by open universities and open \nsources of knowledge to push the transfor\n-\nmations in higher education and we know \nthere are lessons in excellence to learn from \nthe highest forms of collaborative research \nand work. \nAnything else you’d like to say about the \nfuture of education? What will education \nlook like in 2020?\nIf we do not take stock of the systems of edu\n-\ncation, K-12 and 12-20, we will not be able to \nprepare for the future. We need to rethink \nhow we test, how we measure ability and \ndisability, the different ways we can combine \ntalents and collaborate. \n \nI believe that we will have very different \nforms of testing by 2020, that disciplines will \nbe more merged, that school will be more \nproject-based and more integrated into com\n-\nmunities, with less separation of town and \ngown, of the theoretical and the practical.\nWhat do you think is the relationship \n \nbetween free so\n!\nware and open \neducation? Why is it that so many people \nwho are interested in one, are working on \nbuilding the other?\nIf you believe that the best way to develop \nsoftware is for free, collaboratively, and led \nby community interests, then you have to \nquestion a form of industrial education that \nis based almost entirely on credentialing, on \ncertifying, on one person granting a degree of \nexcellence to another, rather than in the ways \nwe, collaboratively, demonstrate excellence by \nperforming well. \nWhat are the main obstacles standing \nin the way of an entirely a\nff\nordable, \naccessible, high-quality, and open world of \nhigher education? Are they technological, \nsocial, ma\n#\ners of government policy or \nthe conduct and structure of institutions?\nTradition dies hard. Once you establish a \nhierarchy of what counts as the pinnacle of \nexcellence (with Oxford and Cambridge in \nEngland, Harvard in the U.S., Tokyo Univer\n-\nsity in Japan) it is hard for those who have \nprofited within that system of hierarchy to \nadmit that reputation is not always equal to \nexcellence, that esteem does not necessarily \nlead to innovation. So institutional resistance, \ndeeply nestled within the class system and \nreward systems, would top the list. There are \nalso billions of dollars resting in the current \nsystem, so there is much resistance to \n \nmajor change.  \nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":67}}}],["04fec96c-d6fc-4888-9c5e-0cc77b514584",{"pageContent":"67\n“We are dedicated to three interconnected \ngoals: creative development of new \nmedia and new tools; thinking critically \nabout the role of technology in \nsociety, education, and social life; and \nparticipatory forms of learning.”\nCATHY DAVIDSON","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":68}}}],["3f134e4d-4f6a-4bf7-b4e5-c02f13cffa2f",{"pageContent":"68\nOne of Davidson’s FutureClass students came away with her own ideas and \nquestions.

This means he’s living the complexities of \nlearning, freedom, and the web like few others. “It’s not that my \nstudents are the smartest in the world; it’s that I believe they can \ndo great things. I put them in an environment where they can \nsee others doing it, and they do,” he says.

I’m interested in open educa\n-\ntion and the free sharing of knowledge from a \nphilosophical point of view.\nCan you describe Seneca’s work with \nthe Mozilla Foundation? What kinds of \nprojects are they working on? What are \nthe goals?\nI have been an active contributor to the \nMozilla project for six years, and have \nbrought hundreds of students with me \ninto Mozilla. I teach students how to work \non something as large and complicated as \nFirefox, and also how to cope in a community \nlike Mozilla. My students work on everything \nMozilla does. I try to let students work on \n(and discover) their passions through Mozilla \nversus having them all work in one area.\nHow do you assess work within a \ncollaborative se\n#\ning such as building \nopen source so\n!\nware? How do you ready \nstudents to work independently on real-\nworld projects and to seek help?\nI grade things like blog posts, bugzilla \ninvolvement, IRC [chat room] involvement, \netc. And instead of just marking the finished \nproduct, I grade the process as much or \nmore. In open source, the code evolves little \nbit by little bit, and if you’re willing to mark \nthat slow evolution on a regular basis, it’s \npretty easy to do assessments.\n \nI throw students into a real project before \nthey are ready, then teach them the skills \nthey need as they need them. If I just taught \nthem the theory of open source, they would \nnever have the need for much of it.

Why is it \nthat so many people who are interested in \none, are working on building the other?\nOpen source is built on community, and in \nparticular, on communities of people who \nhelp each other.

Every one of us working on a project \nlike Mozilla is dependent on others to help us \nunderstand things in the code that we don’t \nknow. The free exchange of knowledge is how \nopen source works, and how the Internet \nworks. It’s natural that people who do this all \nday long will become interested in teaching \nand education, since much of their work is \nabout engaging new contributors and helping \nexisting ones.

He has a \n \nsolemn, sleepy demeanor that breaks easily into laughter.\nTell me about the Open University \n \nof Catalonia.\nWe started in 1994. It’s like the U.K.’s Open \nUniversity, fully virtual. The founding presi\n-\ndent didn’t want to have all the binds and \nstructures of a traditional university. So what \nhe created is a tiny core of people. In our case \nit’s 200 professors for 50,000 students—these \nare coordinators of subjects. We create the \nsyllabus, teaching materials, design what’s \ngoing to happen in the four months of the \nsemester. And then there are 2,000 to 2,500 \nteaching assistants—these are online mentors \nwho enter the classroom. If we have some\n-\nthing synchronous or in-person, it’s not com\n-\npulsory and it’s mandatory that an abstract or \na video is put online. On our Microweb you \ncan find all the books as HTML PDFs. Now \nthat people are getting more DSL we have \nvideo, audio, multimedia.\nSo how is this model doing?\nIt’s growing, popular—but people are threat\n-\nened by the popularity of e-learning. \nThe president of the university was a vision\n-\nary man: he began from scratch. No facul\n-\nties—no people trying to get small kingdoms \nfor themselves. We created a cooperative so \nstudents could buy their own computers. \nAt first, there was a lot of reluctance. It was \nunderstandable: We were very new, very \ndifferent. \n \nBy 2000, e-learning had become more \nnormalized and so we had some pressure \nto offer Spanish courses [rather than just \nCatalan, the regional language], which are \nnow available.\nSo how do the fees work out, and how \nabout the actual costs?\nIt works out to 400 to 700 euros a semester \nfor Catalan courses. For courses in Spanish, \nit’s three to four times more because the \nCatalan government won’t subsidize teach\n-\ning in Spanish.\n \nAs far as the costs, we have a much lower \npayroll than a traditional institution. We \ncharge the students the same, but the gov\n-\nernment subsidizes us at 40 to 50 percent. \nFor a normal university they pay 75 to 80 \npercent.\nProfile:\nI\nSMAEL \nP\nEÑA-\nL\nÓPEZ","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":78}}}],["f198cf9e-8ce8-4b1b-95ed-a031c719e9df",{"pageContent":"78\nAnd who are the students?\nFor 15 years we had the profile of any other \nOpen U—Netherlands, U.K. Dropouts, people \nwho want to study for the sake of it, 98 per\n-\ncent are working, 70 percent have a partner \nand a kid. My former president used to say \nwe were the most successful university in the \nworld in having students working—because \nthey already had the job when they came in!\nBut that’s changed?\nJust now, in the last semester, 25 percent of \nnew students came directly from high school. \nThat’s really new. The average before was like \none percent—people who wanted to study \nsomething like multimedia, which wasn’t \nbeing offered anywhere else. Our average age \nhas dropped from 45 to 35.\nWow! Why do you think that is?\nOne reason is this digital next generation. \nThey have lives online so why not study \nonline? It’s much cheaper. They don’t have to \ncommute or rent a flat.  They can study and \nwork at the same time.\nTell me about your interest in free so\n!\n-\nware and open education.\nAlong with my students, I started an \n \nE-learning for Development nonprofit. We \nuse free people (volunteers), free software \n(our learning platform), and free content—\nto teach either NGOs or people who are in \ndeveloping countries like Morocco or post-\nconflict countries like Bosnia-Herzegovina. \nWe have all kinds of courses like human de\n-\nvelopment, economics, web development. We \ncan do lots of things for free. We need lots of \nways to circumvent the huge structure that’s \nnormally very slow in adapting.\nMy research is also about the digital divide \nor e-empowerment, e-poverty. It’s a big thing \nthat is interrelated. If you can change the \ntransmission of knowledge, that’s one of the \nhuge axes of development. ICTs (informa\n-\ntion and communication technologies) can \nempower people to get their own food, their \nown health, why not their own learning? ICT \nis about decentralization and bringing the \nknowledge back to the people.\nSo it’s really about justice for you. And it \nchanges teaching and learning practice \ntoo, right?\nYes. The teacher becomes a mentor—engag\n-\ning and monitoring, curating more than \njust concentrating the knowledge. We can \ntransform education into learning instead of \nteaching. We have lots of possibilities—why \nstick to old ways of lecturing? The university \nhas proved that a switch is possible but not a \nhuge transformation of the whole system.\n \nPeople normally think that face-to-face is \nrich because you can engage in a conversa\n-\ntion with peers and your teacher/savior. You \ncan talk, you can reflect. They are thinking \nabout the Greeks and Aristotle and those \ndisciples going around the cloister. This is \nonly true for good learning, which hap\n-\npens .00001% of the time—maybe at a posh \nHarvard seminar for 12 graduate students. \nOne of the things we did well in the indus\n-\ntrial revolution was to democratize access to \nknowledge and education. But the tradeoff \nwas about personalization and being able to \nmonitor people very closely.\n \nOnline learning is doing very well in that. \nI have dialogue with my students.

It’s based on the notion that kids are motivated by their \nown interests and encouraged by their peer groups to try new things \nand explore the world around them. We’re sort of taking that \n \nliterally by developing opportunities for ‘structured autonomy’ by \n \nusing the city as the context for learning—city streets as game \n \nboard, for example.\n   \n \nI am personally a big believer in the idea: If we can understand, \nexpand, and control the means to author and create, we can do just \nabout anything. The web is really just a playground for exploration \nand learning, if you look at it this way. Even cooler since the web is a \nnetwork, once you learn one small part of it you’re always going to be \nconnected to many more parts as well. The connections are endless!\n    \n“I’m particularly interested in using the web in physical contexts to \nadd a layer of meaning to the world around us. So we also need open \ntools for mobile web to really bring the notion of an OPEN Internet of \nThings to its fullest potential.”\n    \nLike the Open Web, we consider the city to be a sparking point for \nacquiring significant knowledge, but also a platform for gathering and \nsharing what has been learned or is understood. The urban environ\n-\nment is a playground for discovering places and people, often aided by \nthe use of digital tools, but also for teaching in a distributed way using \npublic spaces as platforms or stages.\n    \nThe intersection between being a digital citizen and an urban \nlearner provides a wide path for exploring, thinking, and showing \none’s views about sustainability, conflict, context, aesthetics, and \nfeelings.

The Internet created open \nstandards and unbundled each layer, so \npeople running the network weren’t running \nthe content. The Internet is organized in lay\n-\ners: the physical cables, TCP/IP, the World \nWide Web, HTML. And each of these layers \nis usually open standard. It’s not encumbered \nby proprietary patents.

Professors \nwere offered a few thousand dollars in incentives in exchange for taking \nthe time to upload their lecture notes and syllabi to the web, for free. Over \nthe past 10 years, tens of foundations, hundreds of schools and dozens \nof governments have released thousands of entire courses from pre-K to \nPhD–video lectures, podcasts, textbooks, exams, serious games, and ev\n-\nerything in between–that can be freely shared, reused, and remixed under \nlicenses like Creative Commons.\n \nCC licensing provides the practical framework for sharing open educa\n-\ntional resources. And maybe more important, it provides a key philosophi\n-\ncal tie among the worlds of learning, freedom, and the web. Education is \na central use case of Creative Commons in its stated mission to “increase \nthe amount of creativity (cultural, educational, and scientific content) in \n‘the commons’—the body of work that is available to the public for free and \nlegal sharing, use, repurposing, and remixing.”\n \nIn the words of Molly Kleinman, a Festival attendee and a librarian at \nthe University of Michigan, “ccLearn [Creative Commons’ learning divi\n-\nsion] is striving to realize the full potential of the Internet to support open \nlearning and open educational resources, and to minimize legal, technical, \nand social barriers to sharing and reuse of educational materials.\n \nIn the United States alone, plummeting budgets and rising costs for both \nK-12 and higher education are making it harder for students and teachers \nto access the quality educational resources they need. Until recently, most \neducational content was locked behind digital paywalls or hidden in print \nbooks, and the free stuff you could find online was often unreliable. Now, \nthe pool of high-quality open educational resources is growing every day, \nwith open textbooks, open courseware, and other experimental projects \npopping up all the time.”\nhttp://\ncreativecommons.\norg/weblog/\nentry/19158\nOPEN CONTENT","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":118}}}],["6b6e77c5-fd53-4fb1-bb53-67dcf0e86ae1",{"pageContent":"118\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":119}}}],["ec50f0f9-df68-4f96-8852-266487a24088",{"pageContent":"119\nIn the emerging world of learning, freedom, and the web, open content is \nthe area that’s farthest down the path of institutional acceptance.

Revolutionary! What was your \ntake on what was going on at “Learning, \nFreedom and the Web”?\nAs I was coming home on the plane, most of \nmy notes were about the badge [alternative \naccreditation] work. The idea that a collabo\n-\nrating, diverse group of people from around \nthe world would be working in a voluntary \n \nassociation with learned and technical so\n-\ncieties to develop curriculum, courses, and \npedagogy that leads to industry-recognized \ncredentials, and that you could earn one, \nmaybe as a graphic artist, and put it on your \nresume, and a potential employer somewhere \ndown the road could click your badge and \nsee your portfolio—I thought that was just \nbreathtaking. Think that through a few years \nfrom now. There’s an employer faced with \ntwo applicants, one with a series of badges \nlinked to representative examples of work \nthat are directly relevant to the job, and the \nother one shows up with a BA from a \n \nbaccalaureate institution. Who’s going to \n \nget the job? It’s at least an open question.  \nSo what’s the government’s role \n \nin this?\nIt was ironic—at another OER gathering not \nlong ago, people were talking about the ideal \nstructure that would make OER sustainable. \nThey said, what we need is an organization \nthat has widespread membership, collects \ndues, and has an interest in educating its \nmembers as efficiently as possible. I pointed \nout that what you’ve just described is some\n-\nthing we call the government. To the degree \nthat governments are not supporting OER, \nthey’re abdicating a fundamental responsibil\n-\nity to provide for their citizens.\nAnd what’s the best way to do that?\nOur proposed policy is that for all education\n-\nally significant intellectual property, what \nthe public pays for, the public should get \naccess to through open license.\nBut can government really take a \n \nleadership role in supporting innovation \nin education without picking winners?  \nThe most important innovations with \neconomic impact have been byproducts of \ngovernment actions: the Internet, the GPS, \nmicroprocessor computers. The government \nis uniquely positioned to provide the kind \nof resources and goals that will incentivize \nand make possible iterative developments \nbeyond what we can imagine.  \n \nOER is about more than efficiencies and \neconomies of scale. It has the potential to \nbreak down the silos in education. OER cre\n-\nates communities of practice, where people \ncan collaboratively improve; we see this as a \nwonderful indispensable tool to improve the \nquality of learning and teaching itself.\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":123}}}],["2ddaebed-0a48-4ece-9e67-1b68d6fb1162",{"pageContent":"123\nThe most important innovations with \n \neconomic impact have been byproducts \n \nof government actions: the Internet, \n \nthe GPS, microprocessor computers. \n \nThe government is uniquely positioned \n \nto provide the kind of resources and goals \nthat will incentivize and make possible \n \niterative developments beyond what we \ncan imagine. \nHAL PLOTKIN","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":124}}}],["e09036ee-1b87-4789-9b47-cccb532b656d",{"pageContent":"124\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":125}}}],["b53cbb90-a5f0-4e92-8c79-d7049fe2be9b",{"pageContent":"125\nO\nPEN\n \nCONTENT\n \nTODAY\n is frustratingly far from reaching its full poten\n-\ntial: free, high-quality lessons for every learner.

As Anna pointed out: “People like me grasp on to technology at \nsuch a young age that the schools just can’t keep up.”\n \nSo, is it possible to make web education work more like the web? Espe\n-\ncially the open web? It turns out that there’s an emerging world of people \ntrying to do just that. Chris Mills, founder of the Open Web Education \nAlliance, says: “So many institutions out there are teaching either no web \ndesign or teaching it in a really outdated crappy way. A community-led \n \napproach can cover more ground a lot quicker.”\nWEBCRAFT","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":152}}}],["5aed3bbf-66fb-404b-bbe0-f9c01c74aade",{"pageContent":"152\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":153}}}],["6e67672e-43c1-40d9-a031-5d095699fb27",{"pageContent":"153\nChris Mills\nChris Mills looks like a typical metalhead.

After traveling \nthe world, and not sure how to reconcile my \ntechnical training with my creative impulses, \nI realized that I was interested in learning \nalmost everything. At the end of 2008 I wrote \na blog post called the Academy of DIY \nhttp://\ndiymasters.battlecat.net/2008/12/19/studying-\nat-the-academy-of-diy/\n in which I speculated \non how I could organize my own Master’s \ndegree by gathering resources, people, and \nmentors around media art and friendship.\n \nI ended up working in a design school as an \neducator and web developer and was incred\n-\nibly frustrated by the hierarchy and bureau\n-\ncracy involved in making changes in the way \npeople learned.

Why is this important \n \nto the world?\nI think the most important thing about free \nand open education is that it offers learning \nchoices to people. It’s not just about helping \npeople from Detroit learn web development \nso that they can find a better job, it’s about \nputting learners of niche subjects such as \ncyberpunk literature together. I think of it as \nthe long tail of learning.\n \nOpen educational resources have given \npeople access to information about learning, \nbut as we develop better ways of having \npeople freely learn together (and shape \ntheir learning) we’re going to have people’s \nminds meeting and growing together.

It is about providing ac\n-\ncess to experiences that would otherwise be \nrestricted by price, where anyone is welcome \nto become a part of the community and drive \nforward with an idea and share their knowl\n-\nedge.

Once you \n‘get’ openness in one context such as soft\n-\nware, you can’t help but realize that those \nsame principles of sharing, collaboration, \nremixing, and innovation are incredibly rel\n-\nevant to many other contexts such as design, \nmusic, and education.

It taps into \na part of our brains that gets undernourished when we spend too much \ntime in front of screens, and helps reach people with different learning \nstyles. Hacking at the level of hardware is essential if we’re to keep the \ncreation and use of the Internet truly free, as mass-produced devices nec\n-\nessarily limit creation in favor of consumption. Plus, it builds community, \ndevelops problem-solving skills, is creative, and fun!\n \nAs Johannes Grenzfurthner, proprietor of the Hackbus, put it, “The \nmain problem with technology nowadays is that the means of produc\n-\ntion are still very centralized. You have all the freedom of information you \nwant on your iPhone, you can blog and tweet and do whatever you like, but \nsomebody had to build this thing somewhere in China in extremely bad \nworking conditions. As long as we cannot download our iPhones for free, \nthere’s a problem. ”\n \nAt the Festival, DIY hacktivists from Europe and the U.S. showed how \nprogramming can escape the screen and move into the public square.\nMembership on Hacker Planet included Monochrom’s Hackbus from \nBerlin, the Arduino team from Italy, and Alison Lewis’s Switchcraft from \nCalifornia.\n \nMaybe we can’t make our own iPhones yet, but tools like Arduino \n \nare the first steps in open-source hardware. Begun about five years ago, \n \nArduino “is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on \nflexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It’s intended for artists, \n \ndesigners, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive\n \n objects or environments.”\n \nArduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of \nsensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and \nother actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using \nthe Arduino programming language (based on Wiring) and the Arduino \ndevelopment environment (based on Processing). Arduino projects can \nbe stand-alone or they can communicate with software on running on a \ncomputer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).\n \nNew applications of Arduino are being invented all the time—that’s the \nbeauty of an open platform. A short list of what people have come up with \nso far includes: the Cupcake CNC (an affordable 3-D printer by \n \nMakerbot), a programmable coffee machine, a wearable microcontroller \ncalled the Lilypad, and a DIY Segway (a self-balancing personal \n \ntransportation device).\nwww.arduino.cc/\nHACKING","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":174}}}],["833dcf6f-90d9-41ed-a7e6-0beed547d190",{"pageContent":"174\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":175}}}],["02ce0765-b173-4089-b537-7a92b9064796",{"pageContent":"175\nHACKING","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":176}}}],["f8991d6e-7532-44a3-a2d0-3be1a3956a5a",{"pageContent":"176\nM\nASSIMO\n B\nANZI\n, a founder of Arduino, gave a funny keynote with \nelegant slides, about how he developed Arduino as “a tool for teaching \nelectronics to designers.” His little box emerged as a great metaphor and \ncase study for all kinds of teaching that leads people gently outside of their \nestablished comfort zones. Banzi explains:\n  \n“Essentially I’m a geek. I studied electrical engineering. Designers don’t \nhave electronics backgrounds—they think visually. We wanted to turn \nelectronics and software into a creative medium available to anybody. \nThe Arduino came from five years of experimentation. We figured that \nwe could teach programming with this thing very quickly, by using \nhardware, instead of just pushing pixels on the screen. It’s the first piece \nof practical open source hardware.\n \n \nIt’s a hands-on teaching methodology. In graduate school, I had the \nadvantage over my friends because I knew how the story ends! I learned \nby plugging wrires: no explosion? no fire? no smoke? Good, I learned \nsomething. So I started teaching like I learn as a kid. We bring people \na child’s open mind and exploration. And our community is incredibly \nimportant in the process. Our Wiki we call the Playground: \nhttp://www.\narduino.cc/playground/\n \n \nAnd we teach workshops in the weirdest places. We discovered that \npeople come to our workshops to find 10 or 20 like-minded people. \nThey learn more from each other than from us. We found that if you put \nyoung engineers and artists in the same place and shake, you get weird \noutcomes. You come spend some time there, they look at you see if you \nfit into the whole system—If you’re a nice person who understands how \nto interact with other people. Then you’re in.”\nAs they explained on their blog, the Arduino crew built a robot at the \n \nFestival: “We wanted to give back to the community what we’ve been \ndoing in the Arduino Playground: Mozduino! We worked on a robot that \nwas able to avoid the obstacles. The first version was based on the sens\n-\ning obstacles with light (using LDR) the second using ultrasounds (using \nPING), the DC motors are driven with Mosfet Modules.

Wednesday was opening night and I \nset up my examples from Switch Craft at the Science Fair and dem\n-\nonstrated how to make them. The participants were inquisitive and \nencouraging. Each question of how and why was followed by a state\n-\nment of confirmation that we do indeed need more women in technol\n-\nogy who love fashion.\n    \nAbout an hour in, it died down and people went inside to hear Joi \nIto, CEO of Creative Commons. I went for the free snacks and wine. \nIt was there that I made a friend. His name is Massimo, one of the \ncreators of Arduino. If you don’t know it already, Arduino is an open-\nsource hardware platform that is used around the world by artists, \ndesigners, architects, teachers, scholars, and just about anyone who \nwants to create an experience with the physical world. He’s famous \namong the DIYers, such as myself, though admittedly I did not recog\n-\nnize him and one of his entourage was kind enough to remind me.\n    \nWe talked and the Arduino crew was very complimentary and \nsupportive. I was honored to talk to them as this is a community I \nhaven’t been a part of in awhile because it involves programming and \nhardware wiring which are a level two for my readers. I tend to stick \nwith level one. At least I did, but after hanging with Massimo, I think I \nam ready to graduate Switch readers to another level of learning.\n    \nI learned that the Arduino platform was created in Italy in a cre\n-\native design program at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea. I had \nknown about this school years ago, but it was shut down in 2005 for \nno apparent reason, just as it was gaining success.\n    \nHe smiled as I explained my passion to get fashion designers, \ncraftsman, and artists into creating with technology. Then he gave me \na cute purple Arduino pin with a heart on it and pointed at one of my \npins and said, “I’ll trade you one of mine for yours. I really like what \nyou are doing here, please feel free to come and hang out with us in \nthe hacker space tomorrow.”\n   \nHis smile made me smile, and that is how friendships are born.\nhttp://www.\niheartswitch.com/\nblog/drumbeat-\nfestival-part-1-lets-\nplay-together            \nHACKING","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":188}}}],["60059a6e-c46e-421c-9ea8-0d91862a088f",{"pageContent":"188\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":189}}}],["b4a0b1e7-a367-43d7-a02d-bd168df26fa9",{"pageContent":"189\nHow To: \nLearn and Play with Arduino \n \nPractice programming, learn about electronics, \n \nand get back in your house a\n\"\ner you’ve locked \n \nyour keys inside.\nDifficulty: \nEasy to moderate\nTime: \n1 hour, 1 day, \n \n1 week, or \n \n1 month\nWho:\n \n1 or many\nMaterials: \nComputer with \nInternet access, \nUSB Arduino \n($29.95 USD), which \nis available here: \nhttp://www.arduino.\ncc/en/Main/Buy, \naccessories\nStep 1: \nFind a project that you’d like to try. \n \nStep-by-step tutorials can be found at:\n \n• www.arduino.cc\n \n• \nwww.sparkfun.com\n \n• \nwww.adafruit.com\n \n• \nblog.makezine.com/archive/arduino\n \n• \nhttp://hacknmod.com/topics/arduino/\n \n• \nhttp://arduinofun.com/\n \n• \nhttp://www.instructables.com/\n \n• \nor by searching Google.\nTip:\n Try the Knock Controlled Door Unlocker, \nposted by “Mr. Hasselhof” at:\nhttp://forum.zomgstuff.net/showthread.\nphp?20710-Arduino-Projects-amp-\nInspiration-for-Beginners\n and \nhttp://www.\nyoutube.com/watch?v=T8eAcbISkXQ\nOr Blinking LEDs, posted at: \nhttp://www.\nsparkfun.com/tutorials/145\nStep 2: \nDownload and install the Arduino software \nto your computer.

There were a lot of JavaS\n-\ncript and HTML coders as well as a few designers and video produc\n-\ntion people. I was totally intimidated by the idea of writing actual \ncode with these guys, and at the same time didn’t want to lose the op\n-\nportunity of learning what they knew. I was also unsure I had enough \nto offer myself, though thankfully I wasn’t the only one to say this.\n    \nWe ended up dividing into two groups. The first, led by Brett Gay\n-\nlor, wanted to create a jazzier, prettier demo of popcorn.js, a JavaS\n-\ncript library that allows you to line up data to particular points on a \nvideo timeline, and thus create mashups like the one they showed the \nday before in which people in the video tell where they’re from and \nthis information is used to trigger Google Maps and Wikipedia giving \nmore information on that location.\n    \nThe second group, which I was a part of, wanted to figure out a way \nto expose existing metadata, like the title, creator, or date a video was \nproduced, that was associated with a video either right in the page \n(with RDFa), or with an external XML file, so that people watching \nthe video could actually see information about the video with a \n \nsingle click.\n    \nI think the part that most surprised me is how small the individual \npieces of the project seemed at first, and how much they all realized \nthat they weren’t really that small, and would take the better part of \nthe day to create, even divided up between the participants as they \nwere. It was also interesting seeing how they wrote the code in a way \nthat they could test it separately, but that it could later fit together \nwith the other pieces. I loved how they really drew on the different \nstrengths of this randomly assembled group of people and made it \npossible to all work together. There was really good energy in \n \nthe room.\n    \nOnce all the code was together, they connected the last computer \nto a projector so that we could all see and debug the final project to\n-\ngether.

Further, we didn’t know \nif people would only want to come for an hour and then leave to at\n-\ntend other sessions, or stick it out with us and stay to build things.\n \n \nIn the first session we had a packed room, and were met with pro\n-\nfessors, filmmakers, web developers, designers, producers, students, \ntranslators, writers, and artists. It was a fantastic group, and had all \nthe energy and diversity we needed to actually build some things. \nAlso, there was a core of people who were determined to stay and see \nthings get finished.\n \n \nOn the first day Brett shot a really quick video getting various \npeople in the square to say where they were from. Nicholas Reville \nthen took the video and had people translate and subtitle it into 17 \nlanguages using the Universal Subtitles project. Next we built a simple \nGoogle Maps tool to allow us to extract longitude and latitude info so \nwe could get geo-data for all the speakers. Finally we put it altogether \nusing Popcorn.js to create a mash-up of the video, Google Maps, and \nWikipedia pages \n \n \nAfter we’d built an example open web video demo together, it was \ntime to think about what we might build next.\n \n \nAfter much debate and discussion, we agreed to take on two proj\n-\nects: 1) make a film about the future of education using the open web; \nand 2) make it possible for librarians, archivists, and other metadata \npeople to have their bibliographic metadata reveal itself to users.\n \n \nThe next day we spent an entire day building things together. The \nmetadata team worked with JavaScript, RDFa, and Dublin Core data, \nand built a custom overlay UI to make it possible to see info like the \nvideo’s title, creator, and date. Meanwhile, the second group took \nadvantage of the incredible set of educational experts on-hand at \nthe festival to conduct interviews on the future of education. This \nbeing Europe, they shot five interviews, each in a different language \n(French, Catalan, German, Italian, and English). They then had these \ntranslated to English, and wrote the subtitles. The rest of the group \nfigured out how to get Flickr and Twitter content to mix with the \nvideo, and worked with the designers on an overall aesthetic.\n \n \nIt was an amazing feeling to work in the lab that day. Everyone was \nengaged and valuable–not one of us able to do everything that had to \nget done.

As Humphrey \nwrote: “It still amazes me that it was all done in one day (before 6:00 \npm!), and I think it captures so much of what was going on at the festival: \neducators, artists, hackers from all walks of life coming together to share, \nlearn, and build.” Somehow, they managed to take advantage of a wide \nvariety of skills and levels of knowledge to pull a project together in record \ntime. Shalom observed that “the number of contributors to this video is \nmind-blowing.” And the finished product wasn’t bad either, as the crowd \nexploded in applause, whoops, and hollers.\n \nVideo as a medium tends to attract devoted followers simply because it’s \ncool.

As I hinted in my interview for the Mozilla Festival \nlast week in Barcelona (which was enjoyably activist/plot the revolu\n-\ntion in vibe)—one of the really tough nuts to crack around open peer \nlearning is accreditation.\n    \nLike many educational institutions, Open U is now experimenting \nwith the accreditation of students’ prior learning and experience in a \nvariety of ways. But Badge Lab was pushing the model to the extreme, \nasking the question at the top.\n    \nWe came up with myriad use cases, categories of badge, worried \nabout whether we were in danger of reinventing the lumbering insti\n-\ntutions we’re trying to move away from, as well as recognizing, but \nnot dwelling upon, the challenge:\n    \nA Badge infrastructure should be agnostic about who is awarding, \nand what the criteria are. Simple is best. Follow the principles of net-\nneutrality that’s made the Internet so successful. How the badge came \nto be awarded should sit outside the system: All the badge infrastruc\n-\nture needs to know is that it was awarded, with some basic, uncon\n-\ntroversial metadata that will allow others to build cool apps on top to \nbrowse, search, visualize, etc.\n    \nA Badge infrastructure is like Verisign: It gives confidence that the \nclaimed badge really was awarded via an authenticated, trustable \ninfrastructure.\n    \nA set of Badges is shorthand: something to scan quickly, a conver\n-\nsation opener to find out the Story Behind The Badge, just as you do \nwhen you see something on a CV, or a LinkedIn endorsement.\n    \nMany Badges will be Low Stakes: they’re not worth gaming the \nsystem to obtain, because their authority derives entirely from the \nawarder’s reputation. Since much of the time the awarder will be un\n-\nknown to a third party, a key attribute of a Badge is the link the owner \nprovides to the story/evidence.\nSimon Buckingham \nShum, who works \non human-centered \ncomputing, \n“sensemaking,” and \ncontent mapping at \nthe Open University, \na government-\nfunded online \nuniversity in the \nU.K., wrote about \nhis ideas on badges \nafter his experience \nat the Festival.\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":223}}}],["311fcc71-2044-4d9c-9e60-bc2e65fb0013",{"pageContent":"223\nhttp://people.\nkmi.open.ac.uk/\nsbs/2010/11/badge-\nlab-at-mozilla-\ndrumbeat/\nT\nHERE\n \nSEEMS\n \nTO\n \nBE\n particular interest in Badges for authentic, practi\n-\ncal learning.

People are precious \nresources, they are full of experiences and knowledge to share.\n    \nThe web is our venue to come together even if we are far away, the \nweb is our tool to learn and get things done/teach things even if, in \nthe beginning, we don’t know how to do it, the web is our opportunity \nto change the thinking of tomorrow...and this is exactly why it is so \nimportant to ensure the openness of the web.\n    \nAll of us must have the possibility to choose when, where, and how \nto learn new things, all of us must have the opportunity to gain access \nto the large variety of information that people share in the web.\n   \nSo, keep it open, share, and you will see that you are not alone \n \nout there.\nhttp://blog.\nnois3lab.it/\narchive/2010-11-21/\nbarcelona-\ndrumbeat-festival\nTHE FUTURE","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":244}}}],["0731f40e-e701-468f-88f5-c3d7a47c0588",{"pageContent":"244\nLEARNING, FREEDOM AND THE WEB","metadata":{"source":"/Users/arvindgirish/Documents/Projects/langchain-js-server/uploads/200 plus pages document.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Learning Freedom and the Web - October 17, 2011","Author":"Anya Kamenetz","Creator":"Adobe InDesign CS5 (7.0)","Producer":"Mac OS X 10.6.6 Quartz PDFContext","CreationDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'","ModDate":"D:20111217051359Z00'00'"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":248},"loc":{"pageNumber":245}}}],["b1cd8bbf-c5ae-423c-9709-cfd46fe45cfb",{"pageContent":"245\nHow To: \nCreate Your Own How To \nPurpose: Share your knowledge in an easily \n \nunderstood format that allows others to try it \n \nand learn too!
